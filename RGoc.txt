Eligiblity Criteria for RGsoc:
All people with non-binary gender identities or who identify as women (transgender or cisgender)
 are welcome to participate in 2019. While we’re not doing an application or submission process this year,
 our goal is still to support and encourage underrepresented people in open source.
 Aside from this, we don’t have any hard requirement for this year’s program, as it’s voluntary, 
self-paced, and flexible based on your schedule. You can even participate without a teammate!
You do not have to be a student at a University to participate, and there are certainly no degree or age limitations.
